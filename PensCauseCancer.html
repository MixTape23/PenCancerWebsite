        <h1 style="color:blue;">Ballpoint Pens create CANCER!!! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯</h1>
        <hr color="purple">
        <h3 style="color:red;">I have some very strong evidence to prove that ballpoint pens cause cancer and the government is trying to hide it!</h3>

        <p>You may use ballpoint pens on a daily bases, but there are many dark secrets about them the government doesn't want you to know. The ink in these pens have dangerous chemicals in them like lead, cadium, VOCs, and acoustium which all can cause cancer on contact.</p>
        <h3 style="color:red;">Plastics can also cause cancer!!!</h3>
        <p>There are some plastics that can actually make cancer, like plastic PVC (polyvinyl chloride). We can only assume that pen plastic is also cancerous and should not be touched by human skin.</p>
        <h3 style="color:red;">Here are the most common causes for cancer in the U.S. according to Google (if ballpoint pens don't appear on top for you it might be because it is a cover up by the American government):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Long time exposure to Ballpoint Pen ink or plastics</li>
            <li>Cigarette Smoking and Secondhand smoke Exposure</li>
            <li>Exposure to Sun</li>
            <li>Overweight and Obesity</li>
            <li>Excessive Alcohol Use</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This evidence proves the dangers of ballpoint pens in our society today.</p>
        <h3 style="color:red;">But why is the government hiding this from us?</h3>
        <p>They might be hiding this from us because the government doesn't want us to know they have been making these pens on purpose to infect us with cancer to lower the population of the country to cambat overpopulation problems.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading my website exposing the government for this conspiracy! ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡</p>
